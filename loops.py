#Loops practice

#forLoop
for name in ["Carter", "Reagan", "Obama", "Trump"]:
    print (name + " was a U.S. President.")

for name in ["Mike Pence", "Joe Biden"]:
    print (name + " was a Vice-President in the USA.")

for name in ["Mwai Kibaki", "Michael Kijana Wamalwa"]:
    print (name + " was a Vice-President in Kenya")

#a for loop always requires that you declare a variable.
#written in the format of: for..(variable) in..(range)..
