print(29 % 5)
# Prints 4 because 29 / 5 is 5 with a remainder of 4

print(32 % 3)
# Prints 2 because 32 / 3 is 10 with a remainder of 2

print(44 % 2)
# Modulo by 2 returns 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd numbers
# The above prints 0

# Youâ€™re trying to divide a group into four teams. All of you count off, and you get number 27.
# Find out your team by computing 27 modulo 4. Save the value to my_team.
# Print out my_team. What number team are you on?
my_team = (27%4)
print(my_team)
#The above will print 3


#Food for thought: what number team are the two people next to you (26 and 28) on? 
# What are the numbers for all 4 teams? 
print(26%4)
print(28%4)
#The above will print 2 and 0 respectively.
