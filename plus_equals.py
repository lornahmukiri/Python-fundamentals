#Python offers a shorthand for updating variables. 
# When you have a number saved in a variable and 
# want to add to the current value of the variable, 
# you can use the += (plus-equals) operator

#Example 1:
milesWalked = 12 #This is our first variable representing the number of miles walked

#Then we want to update the variable above to include another 3 miles we walked,. So:
milesWalked +=3
print(milesWalked)
#...This will print 15.
